# Graph Convolutional Networks for Learning Molecular Fingerprints 
Compilation of models created to learn + generate molecular structures. 

You can also check out the fork of the Graph Convolutional Policy Network [a link], a generative model for SMILES strings.  (https://github.com/seyonechithrananda/rl_graph_generation/tree/test)

The GraphConv QSAR model functions as a model for modelling quantity structure-activity relationships + predicting solubilities in the RDKit Solublity dataset. Data: (https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/blob/master/Docs/Book/data/solubility.train.sdf)

# Note:
GCN_non_policy does not work right now, as I deal with some issues using DeepChem.
