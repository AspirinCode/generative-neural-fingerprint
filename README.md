# gcn-molecule
Compilation of models created to learn + generate molecular structures. 

You can also check out the fork of the Graph Convolutional Policy Network [a link](https://github.com/seyonechithrananda/rl_graph_generation/tree/test)

# Note:
GCN_non_policy does not work right now, as TensorGraph is deprecated. I'm currently looking into other methods.
